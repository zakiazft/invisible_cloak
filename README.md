# invisibility_cloak
 This is how you you can have your own Harry Potter Invisibility cloak.
 
 here, you have to select hsv code of a particular color (in my case red) which will make that colored object invisible.
 I have also used morphological transformation to reduce the noise.
 # prerequisites
 * python 3.7
 * install opecCV library
  > conda install opencv-contrib-python

and you are good to go.
